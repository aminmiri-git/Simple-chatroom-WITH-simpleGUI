...Check if Tkinter is Pre-installed
Tkinter comes pre-installed with most Python distributions. To check, open a Python shell and run:

           import tkinter
           print(tkinter.TkVersion)

If no error occurs and a version number is displayed, Tkinter is already installed.





Another way to verify if Tkinter is installed is to run this code in Command Prompt 

          python -m tkinter

if a Tkinter wondow is opened then it is installed.
